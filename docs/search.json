    "text": "1.3 Context for the Unfamiliar\nChild vaccination is a critical defense against infectious diseases, forming a crucial part of children’s health routines. These essential vaccines, which protect against diseases like measles and polio, faced unprecedented disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, threatening to undo years of healthcare progress.\nUnderstanding the pandemic’s impact on child vaccination is vital. It’s not just about data; it’s about grasping how a global health crisis affects our youngest and most vulnerable. This analysis aims to highlight the consequences of the pandemic, revealing gaps in healthcare that need urgent attention.\nThe significance of this study goes beyond academic interest. It’s about providing insights for decision-makers and health professionals, guiding efforts to strengthen and recover child vaccination programs. This work is essential in ensuring the pandemic doesn’t compromise our commitment to safeguarding children’s health and future."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\n\n2.1.1 Data Sources\n\n2.1.1.1 UNICEF’s State of the World’s Children Report 2023\nThe UNICEF report is a comprehensive resource offering extensive data on child health and vaccination. This dataset is pivotal in understanding the global landscape of child immunization, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides a detailed overview of vaccination rates, types of vaccines administered, and coverage across various demographic segments.\n\n\n2.1.1.2 WHO Immunization Data\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) offers a global perspective on immunization, with data encompassing coverage and health indicators. This dataset is crucial for comparative analysis, allowing for a broader understanding of how different regions and countries fare in their vaccination efforts.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Data Collection and Format\n\n2.1.2.1 UNICEF\nUNICEF’s data compilation is a rigorous process involving health surveys and reports from national health systems. The data is methodically structured, typically in formats like CSV, which facilitates ease of analysis and integration into various data processing tools.\n\n\n2.1.2.2 WHO\nWHO’s data is sourced from national health departments, ensuring standardization and reliability. The data is made available in user-friendly formats such as CSV and through APIs, which offers flexibility for data analysts and researchers in how they access and utilize the information.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Frequency\nBoth UNICEF and WHO datasets are updated annually, providing a timely snapshot of the global state of child vaccination. These datasets encompass various dimensions, including but not limited to:\n\nVaccine Type: Detailed data on different vaccines administered globally.\nCoverage Rate: Insights into the percentage of the target population receiving vaccinations.\nGeographical Data: Country-wise and region-wise vaccination statistics.\nAge Group: Vaccination data segmented by different age groups, which is vital for understanding the demographics of vaccination coverage.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Dimensions\n\nDemographics: Rows (247) x Columns (35)\nChild Mortality: Rows (245) x Columns (43)\nMaternal And Newborn Health: Rows (262) x Columns (27)\nChild Health: Rows (264) x Columns (34)\nAdolescent Health: Rows (263) x Columns (35)\nHIV AIDS Epidemiology: Rows (240) x Columns (14)\nHIV AIDS Intervention Covera: Rows (247) x Columns (18)\nNutrition: Rows (275) x Columns (26)\nNutrition - Breastfeeding: Rows (256) x Columns (26)\nEarly Childhood Development: Rows (250) x Columns (46)\nEducation: Rows (250) x Columns (45)\nChild Protection: Rows (259) x Columns (44)\nSocial Protection And Equit: Rows (250) x Columns (15)\nWASH: Rows (247) x Columns (45)\nAdolescents: Rows (254) x Columns (36)\nChildren with disabilities: Rows (247) x Columns (43)\nWomen’s Econ Empowerment: Rows (255) x Columns (42)\nMigration: Rows (245) x Columns (19)\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Issues\nOne of the challenges in working with such extensive datasets is the potential for inconsistencies. These may arise due to variations in data collection methods across different countries or changes in reporting standards. Such discrepancies need to be acknowledged and addressed in the analysis to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n2.1.6 Import Plan\nTo handle these rich datasets, the project will leverage R, a powerful tool for data analysis. Utilizing packages like tidyverse, the data import process will be streamlined, allowing for efficient handling of Excel files. The choice of R also opens up a plethora of options for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization, making it an ideal environment for this analysis.\n\n\n2.1.7 Documentation of Sources\nThe sources for this data are:\n\n[UNICEF Immunization Data](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/the-state-of-the-worlds-children-2023-statistical-tables/\n\nThese sources provide the foundational data for this project, offering a comprehensive view of the state of child vaccination globally."
